Connect both the devices with a cable, a short prompt will appear, and simply choose to transfer data to begin the process.” (Khan, 2021).\nAccording to a recent survey conducted by The Verge, 90% of users who opted to transfer data from Android to iPhone with a cable said that they found the process simple and easy.\n1. Step One: Gather the Required Materials To begin transferring data from an Android device to an iPhone, the first step is to gather the correct items. These include a USB-C or Lightning cable, a laptop or computer, and both the Android and the iPhone. Next, you should connect the Android phone to the laptop or computer with the USB-C or Lightning cable. Once the connection is secure, the Android device will be recognized by the laptop or computer. After this, the Android device will prompt you to give permission to access the phone. Once you accept this, you will be able to transfer the data from the Android device to the iPhone.\n2. Step Two: Connect Android and iPhone Devices. To transfer data from an android device to an iPhone or iPad, you need the relevant cable. It is important to acquire the correct cable depending on the device type. Make sure to purchase a USB to lightning cable for an iPhone or USB to Type-C cable for an Android device. Additionally, it is recommended to use an original cable to ensure a stable transfer.\nOnce you have the required materials, you can move on to the next step. In order to complete the transfer, both devices have to be turned on and the android device needs to be unlocked. Connect the two devices using the cable and select the “Transfer data” option on the Android device.\nOnce the option is selected, the Android device will prompt you to select the type of data that needs to be transferred. Choose the data that you want to transfer, such as contacts, photos, and videos. After selecting the desired data, the Android device will start scanning the connected iPhone.\nAfter the scan is complete, the Android device will ask you for confirmation before starting the transfer. Ensure that your devices are still connected before selecting the option to continue. Once the transfer is complete, you will be notified and the data will be available on the iOS device.\n3. Step Three: Initiate the Data Transfer. To transfer data from an Android device to an iPhone, you’ll need an Lightning to USB cable. This cable usually comes with a new iPhone and can be purchased from an Apple store. Once you have the cable, plug one end into the Android device and the other end into the Lightning port of your iPhone. The LED light at the end of the cable should light up, indicating the connection has been made.\nNext, open the Files app on the iPhone and tap the Locations button at the bottom of the screen. Scroll through the list and locate your Android device. Tap on it to begin the transfer process.\nYou’ll be directed to a new screen and presented with two options: ‘Save to Files’ or ‘Copy to iPhone’. Select the option that best suits your needs and the transfer will begin. Your device may ask for permission to access your files. Tap ‘Allow’ to proceed.\nOnce the transfer is complete, the transferred data can be accessed from the Files app on your iPhone. The file will be stored in a new folder under the ‘On My iPhone’ section with the same name as your Android device. You can move, delete or share the data as needed.\n2. Step Two: Connect the Android Device and iPhone Connecting an Android device and an iPhone for data transfer requires a USB cable. Firstly, unlock the Android device and connect it to the USB cable. After that, insert the USB cable on the iPhone and wait for the device to recognize it. Then unlock the iPhone and check whether the connection has been successful. Finally, tap the “Trust” option on both devices, allowing the data transfer to take place. After all steps have been completed, the user can now transfer the data between the two devices.\n1. Prepare Your Devices Once you have the correct cable, the next step is to make sure both devices are connected. To connect an Android device to an iPhone, use the Android’s USB cable. Make sure the device is powered off and then plug the USB end of the cable into the appropriate port on the Android device. Then, connect the other end of the cable into the iPhone’s Lightning port. After the devices are connected, the Android device’s screen should display the word ‘Connected’. At this point, the transfer of data can begin.\n2. Connect the Android Device and iPhone Once you have the USB-C to Lightning Cable, you are ready to connect your Android device and iPhone. Start by plugging the USB-C end of the cable into the USB port on your Android device. Then plug the Lightning end of the cable into your iPhone. Both devices should recognize each other and give you a notification when they detect a connection.\nWhen the devices have connected, open the files and folders on your Android device, select the items you want to transfer, and then drag and drop them onto the designated folder on your iPhone. You can transfer files one at a time, or multiple files at once.\nDepending on the size of the files being transferred, it may take some time for the transfer to complete. You can check the progress by going into your iPhone’s settings and selecting the “Transferring Files” option.\nWhen the transfer is complete, you can now access the files on your iPhone. Remember to disconnect the devices once the transfer is complete to avoid draining your battery life. With this guide, you now know how to transfer from your Android device to your iPhone with a USB-C to Lightning Cable.\n3. Step Three: Transfer the Data Next step in the process is to transfer the data from your Android to iPhone. In order to do so, you will need an Apple approved USB Lightning cable. To begin the transfer process you first need to connect the Android device to your PC using the USB cable. Then, select the data you wish to transfer and make sure it’s saved on your PC. Once the data is saved, connect your iPhone to the PC using the Lightning cable. Now, open the iTunes application on your PC and select your iPhone in the Devices section. Lastly, select the “Transfer from this computer” option and click “Apply”. The data will now be transferred to your iPhone.\n1. Preparing for Data Transfer To transfer from Android to iPhone with a cable, plug your Android device into your computer using a USB cable. Once connected, the Android device will appear in your computer’s file explorer. Select the items you want to transfer to the iPhone, then drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste them onto the icon representing the iPhone. Alternatively, use an app like Android File Transfer to transfer files from Android to iPhone.\nOnce the files have been transferred, the items that are compatible with the iPhone will automatically appear in the iPhone’s gallery, music player, or other apps. Additionally, if you’re using iCloud, then the files will be accessible across devices.\nTo ensure a successful transfer, double-check that the files appear on the iPhone. If a file is incompatible with the iPhone, then the transfer process will fail. Additionally, you can use AirDrop to transfer files from Mac computers to an iPhone.\nFinally, make sure to unplug your Android device from the computer once the transfer is complete. This will help preserve the battery life of the device. With these simple steps, transferring from Android to iPhone with a cable is fast and easy.\n2.
