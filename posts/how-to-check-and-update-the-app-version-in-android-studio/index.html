Understanding Android Manifest Understanding Android Manifest is an important part of any Android application. It contains information about the application such as its version, package name, the team name, target SDK, the name of the main activity, and much more. It is important to understand the Android Manifest if you want to create an application that is easily maintainable. In this tutorial, we will learn how to get the app version in Android Studio.\nThe application’s version is registered in the Android Manifest file inside the versionName attribute of the tag. This versionName string is what the user sees when they view the application in the Google Play Store. It does not necessarily have to match the actual version name of the application. To retrieve the versionName from the Android Manifest, we can use the PackageManager class.\nThe PackageManager class is used for retrieving information about an Android application. We can call the getPackageInfo() method which will return a PackageInfo object. This object will contain information about the application including the versionName. The versionName is stored in the versionName field of the object and can be accessed by calling its getVersionName() method.\nIn this tutorial, we have learned how to get the app version in Android Studio. Using the PackageManager class, we can call the getPackageInfo() method and retrieve the versionName from the returned PackageInfo object. We hope this tutorial has been helpful and that you now understand how to get the app version in Android Studio.\nB. Accessing App Version in Android Studio Android manifest is an essential part of the android development process, as it provides an easy and effective way to manage configuration and metadata for an android application.It contains information regarding the application components, the permissions that it requires, the hardware and software features required for the application to run, and the application versions.
