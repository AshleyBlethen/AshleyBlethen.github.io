Steps to Upgrade Gradle Version Upgrading Gradle version in Android Studio Flutter can be a difficult process, but there are a few steps that can help make things smoother. Firstly, run the check for updates command in Android Studio using the Help menu. This will search for the latest Gradle distribution version. Secondly, if a newer version is available, a notification will appear in the lower right corner. Press this button to start the update process. Thirdly, restart the Android Studio and the latest Gradle version is now being used. Finally, if you want to check whether your Gradle version is up to date, go to the Gradle Scripts section and check the gradle.properties file. By following these steps you can easily upgrade your Gradle version to the latest one.\n1. Upgrading Gradle Version Upgrading Gradle version in Android Studio Flutter is easy and can be completed in several steps. First, open the project’s “android/gradle/wrapper” directory and edit the “gradle-wrapper.properties” file.
