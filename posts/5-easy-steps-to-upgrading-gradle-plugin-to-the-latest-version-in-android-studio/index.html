However, if you are upgrading to a major version release, you should double-check that all your code is compatible with the new version.</p><p>Q5 : What happens if I encounter any errors during the upgrade process?
A5 : If you encounter any errors during the Gradle Plugin upgrade process, you can always undo the upgrade and go back to the old version. It is recommended that you back up your project before attempting to upgrade, as this will make it easier to recover the older version of Gradle Plugin in case of any issues.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://ashleyblethen.github.io/posts/5-easy-steps-to-capture-a-screenshot-on-your-samsung-s22-ultra/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>5 Easy Steps to Capture a Screenshot on Your Samsung S22 Ultra</span></a>
