Transferring Data from Android to iPhone<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-transferring-data-from-android-to-iphone>#</a></h3><p>Transferring WhatsApp data from an Android device to an iPhone after setup can be a time-consuming task. However, there are some helpful methods that can make the process easier. The most efficient way to transfer WhatsApp data is to use a third-party app such as Move to iOS or the Google Drive method. The first step when using Move to iOS app is to download the app on both the sending and receiving devices then follow the on-screen instructions.

Lastly, users can use a computer to transfer their WhatsApp data by connecting their devices to the computer, backing up the Android device’s data, and then transferring the data to the iPhone. Any of these methods should help facilitate the transfer of WhatsApp data from an Android device to an iPhone after setup.</p><h2 id=3-after-the-transfer>3.
