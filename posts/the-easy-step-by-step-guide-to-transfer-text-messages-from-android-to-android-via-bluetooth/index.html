It&rsquo;s an easy and quick process that takes only a few minutes. Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to help you transfer text messages between two Android devices.
First, enable Bluetooth on both devices by going into Settings > Bluetooth and turning it on. Now make sure the two devices are paired by going to Settings > Bluetooth, selecting the devices and tapping Pair.
