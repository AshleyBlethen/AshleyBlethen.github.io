Installing APK on Sony Android TV<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-installing-apk-on-sony-android-tv>#</a></h3><p>Installing apps on a Sony Android TV from a USB drive is not too difficult and can provide a convenient way to add new apps to your device. It’s important to make sure that the version of the APK you’re installing is compatible with your device so you don’t run into any issues. It’s also important to make sure that your USB drive has enough space to store the APK files. Here are the steps to follow to install the apps on a Sony Android TV from a USB drive:</p><p>First, insert the USB drive into your Sony Android TV. Then, go to the settings tab and select the “USB and Storage” option. Next, select the drive you wish to install the app from and navigate to the APK file. Once you have located the APK file, select it and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.</p><p>Once the installation process is complete, you should be able to launch the app from the home screen. It is advised to always keep the USB drive connected until you have finished using the app, as this can help prevent any potential data loss.</p><p>Finally, if you encounter any problems while installing the apps, try restarting your device and then restarting the installation process. Ensure that all the required drivers are installed and updated, and that your device has enough storage space for the app. Following these tips should help make the installation process smoother.</p><h3 id=2-potential-problems-to-consider>2. Potential Problems to Consider<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-potential-problems-to-consider>#</a></h3><p>Installing apk on sony android tv from usb is a relatively simple process, but there are a few tips and potential problems that you should be aware of.

Lastly, if you ever have trouble installing an apk, a factory reset of the device can often solve all the issues. So, if that doesn’t work, try a reset before calling customer support.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlURpyjNKCw style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
