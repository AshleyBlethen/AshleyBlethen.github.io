Common Issues When Taking Screenshots on iPad Mini without Home Button<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#3-common-issues-when-taking-screenshots-on-ipad-mini-without-home-button>#</a></h2><p>Taking screenshots on iPad Mini can be a daunting task if you do not know the right way. For iPad Mini devices without a Home button, taking screenshots requires two different methods. First, you can activate the AssistiveTouch to take a screenshot. Second, you can take screenshots with the Power + Volume up button. Both techniques are easy to use and this tutorial will guide you through the process step-by-step.</p><p>AssistiveTouch is a feature of the iPad Mini system that allows you to take a screenshot without pressing any buttons. To activate this feature, simply tap on the Settings icon, then go to General > Accessibility > AssistiveTouch. Here, turn on the AssistiveTouch option and then tap the Create New Gesture button. This will open a window where you can enter a two- or three-finger gesture. Once you have your gesture ready, you can take a screenshot by simply tapping on the AssistiveTouch icon and then entering your gesture.</p><p>The second way to take a screenshot on an iPad Mini without a Home button is to press the Power + Volume up buttons simultaneously for a few seconds. This action will capture the image on the screen and store it in the Photos app. You can then crop and edit the screenshot as you wish.</p><p>These are two ways you can take screenshots on an iPad Mini without a Home button. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully for successful screenshotting.</p><h3 id=1-taking-screenshots-on-ipad-mini-without-home-button>1. Taking Screenshots on iPad Mini without Home Button<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#1-taking-screenshots-on-ipad-mini-without-home-button>#</a></h3><p>Taking screenshots on iPad mini without home button can sometimes be a tricky task. The first issue you might encounter is the lack of a Home Button. Since the iPad mini without the Home Button runs with the iOS 11 and higher, the Home Button has been replaced with a gesture. To take a screenshot on this type of iPad mini, you need to use the Power and Volume Up buttons simultaneously. Another issue that you might face is the black screenshot images. This is usually caused by a lack of sufficient memory on the ios device. To fix this issue, you should simply delete some unnecessary files from the device. You can also try restarting the device after deleting the files. Finally, there is the issue of not being able to view the screenshot immediately after taking it. This is a common issue for Apple devices. To view your screenshots, go to the Photos app and select the Albums tab. Here you should be able to view all the screenshots you have taken. With these steps in mind, you should now be able to take screenshots on iPad mini without Home Button without any issues.</p><h3 id=2-troubleshooting-screenshot-issues-on-ipad-mini>2.
