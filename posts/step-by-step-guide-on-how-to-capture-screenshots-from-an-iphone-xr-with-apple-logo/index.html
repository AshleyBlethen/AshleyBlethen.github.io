After the Assistive Touch is enabled, a floating menu will appear on the screen. Tap the ‘Device’ icon from the floating menu and then click on ‘More’. Finally, select the ‘Screenshot’ option and wait for the Apple Logo to flash on the screen. With this approach, you can easily capture the screenshot with the Apple Logo on your iPhone XR.</p><h3 id=2-capturing-the-screenshot>2. Capturing the Screenshot<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-capturing-the-screenshot>#</a></h3><p>Capturing screenshots on iPhone XR with the Apple logo gives you the opportunity to share your achievement in a unique and stylish way.

You should then see the Apple logo in the top-right corner, as well as the other app icons that have been moved down. Next, press and hold the Side button and then press the Volume Up button at the same time. You will then see the screenshot flash at the bottom of the screen. Finally, simply let go of both buttons. Your screenshot will now be saved to your Camera Roll, where you can edit, crop and share it with friends easily.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIPR4nSgEgM style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is a static site and how does it relate to Hugo?
A1: A static site is a website that is built using pre-written HTML code and does not require any server-side code to render content. Hugo is a popular open-source static site generator, which is used to create sites from text files written in a markup language such as Markdown, reStructuredText, or AsciiDoc. Hugo takes the content, renders it in HTML format, and stores it as a static site.</p><p>Q2: What do I need to capture screenshots from my iPhone XR with Apple Logo?

Additionally, you may need to install any required components or drivers provided by your third-party app.</p><p>Q3: What is the process for capturing screenshots from my iPhone XR with Apple Logo?
A3: The process for capturing screenshots from an iPhone XR with Apple Logo involves connecting the device to a computer, launching the third-party app you have chosen, and then using the app to take the screenshots. Depending on the app you use, you may have to enable mirroring on the iPhone before you can take screenshots.</p><p>Q4: Once I have taken a screenshot, what can I do with it?
A4: Once you have taken a screenshot from your iPhone XR with Apple Logo, you can use it for a variety of purposes. You can share it with friends, post it on social media, use it as evidence for a dispute, print it, or store it for future use.</p><p>Q5: Are there any risks associated with taking screenshots from my iPhone XR with Apple Logo?
A5: Taking screenshots from your iPhone XR with Apple Logo is generally harmless and poses no direct risks. However, you should be aware that the screenshots you take may contain sensitive information which, if shared with the wrong person, could put your privacy at risk.
