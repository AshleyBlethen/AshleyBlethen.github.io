Then, the data can be backed up and restored to the new device. Additionally, it is beneficial to have a backup solution in place, such as a cloud storage or a computer, to provide a safeguard against future data losses. Finally, it is important to keep the Android device updated with the latest security patches to protect against potential data thefts. These steps should ensure a successful and secure data transfer.\nSteps to Transfer Data When transferring text messages from an Android to another Android with a broken screen, the best option is to use a third-party tool like Android Broken Data Recovery.

Transferring Text Messages to the New Device<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-transferring-text-messages-to-the-new-device>#</a></h3><p>Text messages are an invaluable resource for communication and holding onto memories. But what do you do if the screen of one of your Android phones is broken? You don’t need to worry if this problem arises, as there are ways to transfer text messages from one Android with a broken screen, to another. Here is a step-by-step guide to follow for instructions on how to make the transfer.</p><p>Firstly, download and install the Android Data Recovery program onto your computer, and then connect your Android phones to the machine. After a few moments, the program will detect both phones. After that, the application will then start to scan the Android phone with the broken screen to access its messages.</p><p>Once the scanning phase is complete, all recoverable data will be listed in the program. Then, select the messages that need to be transferred and click the &lsquo;Recover&rsquo; button. Finally, the chosen messages will be recovered and saved as a .csv, .xml, or .txt file in the designated folder.</p><p>Once the file has been saved, disconnect one phone and then re-connect the other one. Now, the same program should detect the connected device. To begin transferring the text messages, the .csv, .xml, or .txt file should be imported into the device. Once the import process is complete, all the desired messages will be transferred from one phone to the other.</p><p>Following this step-by-step guide, you can successfully transfer text messages from one Android with a broken screen to another. This process is simple, efficient, and can save a lot of time when you’re in need of transferring important messages.</p><h2 id=--conclusion-summarization-of-steps-taken-and-other-tips-for-transferring-data>- Conclusion: Summarization of steps taken and other tips for transferring data.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#--conclusion-summarization-of-steps-taken-and-other-tips-for-transferring-data>#</a></h2><p>Transferring text messages from a broken Android device to another can be a complicated process.

Finally, it is important to keep the Android device updated with the latest security patches to protect against potential data thefts. These steps should ensure a successful and secure data transfer.</p><h3 id=steps-to-transfer-data>Steps to Transfer Data<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#steps-to-transfer-data>#</a></h3><p>When transferring text messages from an Android to another Android with a broken screen, the best option is to use a third-party tool like Android Broken Data Recovery. It allows you to extract and backup data from the broken screen with ease. You just have to connect the broken Android to the computer, and the program will do the rest. After extracting the data, you can then transfer it to another Android device via USB or wirelessly via Bluetooth. Additionally, you can also backup all your data before starting the process to ensure no data gets lost.</p><p>When transferring text messages from a broken screen, users should also make sure that the original OS version of the source phone is the same as the target phone. This can help avoid compatibility issues. Additionally, do not forget to create a backup of all existing text messages before transferring them to the new device for easy recovery if any data is lost during the process.</p><p>In addition, users should be aware of the current storage capacity on the target device before transferring the data. If the target device doesn&rsquo;t have enough space to accept the data, users should free up some space by deleting unused apps and files. Once the storage capacity is enough, the data can be transferred successfully.</p><p>Finally, users should consider using a trusted mobile data transfer tool. It can help users with a smooth and secure data transfer process that is free from any unwanted errors. By following the tips mentioned above, users can transfer their data from the broken Android screen with ease.</p><h3 id=additional-tips-for-transferring-data>Additional Tips for Transferring Data<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#additional-tips-for-transferring-data>#</a></h3><p>When your android phone screen is broken and you need to transfer text messages from it to another android phone, there are some steps you can take to ensure a successful process.
