One of the most efficient and popular methods of transferring data from one Android device to another is to use a USB cable. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to transfer data from an Android device to another using a USB cable. First, plug the USB cable into your source Android device. Then plug the other end of the cable into your second Android device. On the source device, click on the “Connect to PC” option. You will be asked if you want to transfer data using USB. Select “Yes” on both devices. Now the two devices should be connected and you can start transferring data from one device to another. It is important to make sure that the two devices you are transferring data between have the correct USB settings enabled. If your devices don’t, you won’t be able to transfer any data. Once the data sharing process is complete, disconnect the USB cable and the two devices will be disconnected. With this, you have learned how to transfer data from one Android device to another using a USB cable.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_CVzm_vNHpY style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: How can I transfer data from Android to Android using a cable connection?
